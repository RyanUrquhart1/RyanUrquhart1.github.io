As part of this programme I am completing an Msc over the next two years to further develop my research and analytical skills. </P>
<P> My experience in eduction has been fairly interdisciplinary to this point, having studiend Journalism at undergraduate level and leaving University for employment for three years before coming to the University of Leeds to complete my masters degree in Msc Consumer Analytics and Marketing Strategy.
