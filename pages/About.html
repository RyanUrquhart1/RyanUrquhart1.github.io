  <h1>More about this website</h1>

  <p>
    As mentioned on the home page of this site, I have created this website as part of the assement criteria for GEOG5995 Programming for Social Sceientists. Although it has been created for this purpose my intention is to develop this into a porfolio site over the course of my PhD and the next four years.
  </p>
  <p>
    The creation of this website represents my first attempt at handcrafting a HTML page, and my first real use of HTML and CSS in any context. I have made the decision to avoid Markdown code and pre made templates to have more control over the creation process and to gain a better understanding of the code that goes into website creation. It is a process I have enjoyed and I have been finding HTML fairly intuitive, as of right now the website may be a little bare bones and fairly simple, however this is something I intend to develop going forward, as my skills and knowledge of HTML and CSS improve so will this website.
  </p>
  <p>
    As this is my first experience creating a website I have made a concious decision to keep things fairly minimilistic with a plain white background, centered content with margins at either side and standard top navigation. This may change over time, my page formatting is dictated by a seperate CSS style sheet as per HTML coding expectations, giving my pages consistency in their design. My navigation behaves as navigation should, it is clearly for moving around the site, the colour and style changes as you hover and click and the links are laid out logically, and importantly all links are working! 
  </p>
  <p>I have attempted to format and present my code in my understanding of a proffesional manner in terms of spacing, indentation and clarity. The code for each page can be inspected by right clicking and choosing to view page source, alternatively all code is available as a Github Repository. <a href="https://github.com/RyanUrquhart1/RyanUrquhart1.github.io">Click here to go to the repository.</a>
