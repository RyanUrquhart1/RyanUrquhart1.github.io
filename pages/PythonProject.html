  <p>
    This page will introduce the basics behind the Agent Based Model created for the first assingment of this course. Example visual outputs created by the model can be seen to the left of this page, however it should be noted that due to the nature of agent based modelling, outputs will differ each time the model is run, they are provided as an example only.</p>
  </p>
  <p>
    The idea behind this project was an introduction to coding agent based models using using the Python coding language. The model showcasing a relitively simple simulation of how sheep behave in a set environment and the interaction between the sheep and the environment. In this conext the sheep are the 'agents' and the pysical environment around them is the environment they interact with.
